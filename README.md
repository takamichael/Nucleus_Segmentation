# Nucleus_Segmentation
To segment Nucleus cells from DAPI stains. This Notebook was made to segment out nucellus cells that were hard to see by eye in 40X and 20X cells. It was used to identify nuclear size and shape for mice liver and lung samples.

"Nucleus_Dapi_UNET.ipynb " is a googlecolab notebook that has the code of how I trained the U-Net model. 

'Pipeline_Lung_Nucleus_Cell area.ipynb' - notebook is to run the trained U-Net model made on the lung dataset.
